# Getting started

This is the collection of styles and design patterns that make up [beta.FEC.gov](https://beta.fec.gov/). Like the main site, the style guide is a work in progress. We don't yet have a full list of design patterns or complete documentation, but we're actively developing these resources as we build the site.

[Let us know](https://github.com/18f/fec-style/issues) how we can improve.
