# Getting started

This is the collection of styles and design patterns that make up [beta.fec.gov](https://beta.fec.gov/). Like the main site, the style guide is a work in progress, and you may not find complete documentation behind what's here, or a full list of design patterns.

[Let us know](https://github.com/18f/fec-style/issues) how we can improve.
