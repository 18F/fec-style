# Getting started

This is the collection of styles and design patterns that make up [beta.FEC.gov](https://beta.fec.gov/). Like the main site, the style guide is a work in progressâ€” you may not find a full list of design patterns or complete documentation behind what's here.

[Let us know](https://github.com/18f/fec-style/issues) how we can improve.
